App to play the popular Ghost game

## Running this app
With android studio it's possible to clone the project directly from github and open it. 
After that it's a matter of running the app just as any android studio project. 

## The Rules
The players submit letters in turn. The goal is to evade all losing conditions, which are:

- Creating a word longer than 3 letters.
- Creating a sequence of letters which can't result in a word by adding additional letters.

Matching any of the losing conditions doesn't make that player lose instantaneously.
The player only loses if the other player presses the *Bullshit!* button.
Note, however, that pressing the *Bullshit!* button when the current word is not in a losing state
actually makes the current player lose the game.
